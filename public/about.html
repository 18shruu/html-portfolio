<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello Shruthi! I'm a passionate and motivated software developer with a background in Electronics and Communication Engineering. While my academic foundation lies in the world of circuits and signals, my curiosity and love for problem-solving led me to the realm of software development, where I discovered my true calling. Currently, I work as an Associate Software Engineer, focusing on backend development, APIs, and database optimization.</p>

<p>My journey into programming began during my undergraduate years, where I explored various projects that combined both hardware and software elements. Over time, I found myself gravitating more toward the software side, leading me to pursue personal projects, online courses, and hands-on development. These experiences helped me build a strong understanding of Python, Java, and modern web frameworks like Django and Spring Boot.</p>

<p>In my current role, I’ve contributed to building and improving RESTful APIs, handling complex data operations using Delta Lake, and working with PostgreSQL for efficient data storage and retrieval. I've also gained valuable experience collaborating with cross-functional teams, debugging critical issues, and writing clean, scalable code. I always strive to write maintainable solutions and continuously improve my technical and communication skills.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I’m passionate about learning emerging technologies, especially in the areas of artificial intelligence and cloud computing. I enjoy participating in technical discussions, attending developer meetups, and mentoring peers whenever I get the chance. I’m also involved in community service and have volunteered to teach underprivileged children, combining my love for education and social impact.</p>

<p>I believe in continuous learning, taking initiative, and building solutions that make a difference. Whether it’s a new project, a collaborative opportunity, or simply a knowledge-sharing session, I’m always excited to connect and grow. Feel free to explore my work and reach out—I’d love to hear from you!</p>
